  - In the first Rocket Jump Racing event, someone had to bring a flame from earth
    to the planet the event was being held on. Unfortunatly the first planet had
    an atmosphere of pure propane.
  - Rocket Jump Racing is often confused for the Rocket Jumping Race, where people
    jump from rockets and race. Not to the ground mind you, instead they must land
    and then race to the finish line, with whatever bones they have left.
  - I've been beyond the edge of the universe. What? You want to know what's out
    there? Too bad, you didn't invite me to your birthday party so now I'm not telling
    you.
  - Execute Hint Number 66!
  - 2 + 2 = 4, and Explosives + a televised racing event = A pretty good cover-up.
  - The Finnish Line is pretty cold, which makes sense because it borders between
    Sweden and Finland. Not to be confused with the finish line that you're racing
    towards which is anything but cold, since it's highly radioactive.
  - Ha ha hint #69 ha ha funny number.
  - What do you do with chemistry puns? You Barium! Actually you get swiftly and
    thoroughly slapped without mercy.
  - The word "Lazer" may not be the correct spelling, but lets be fair, it's way
    cooler to spell it that way.
  - Did you know you can play this game with voice controls? Try shouting things
    like "jump", "shoot", and "run" to look like a complete idiot.
  - This joke is funny, laugh or be forced to watch childrens programming for 72
    hours straight.
  - This game is like an industrial grade belt sander for the brain, gotta get all
    the wrinkles out.
  - I would take a bullet for you, but there's an equally likely scenario where I'm
    the one pulling the trigger so take that as you will.
  - Fun fact! My voice is actually unfathomable, hence why I communicate through
    text. If you heard it, your brain would literally melt into a puddle! I heard
    liquid brain is a pretty good nasal decongestant though.
  - Finger guns are lethal! Last week a guy pointed finger guns at me and he completly
    murdered any respect I had for him.
  - The bigger they are, the harder they fall on top of you and crush all your bones.
  - I remember the last time I drank water. Man 30 years ago was a wild time.
  - Time is a straight line, like a curly fry.
  - I'm a free spirit. As in, my spirit is free but my body is still stuck here,
    souless.
  - My friend once let me borrow his banjo and he said I had to give it back, no
    strings attached. I gave it back to him and he got mad because I actually gave
    him the bubonic plague.
  - Who is Layman and why is he such an idiot?
  - Relax, playing this game has a very low fatality rate.
  - Fun fact! The universe actually resents the concept of my very being! I continue
    to exist purely out of spite!
  - 'Shroomapple shroomapple ai ai ah. Shroomapple shroomapple ai ai ah. Shroomapple
    shroomapple ai ai ah. Shroomapple shroomapple ai ai ah. Shroomapple shroomapple
    ai ai ah. Shroomapple shroomapple ai ai ah. '
  - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS OF ALL AGES... HI.
  - 'Whenever you leave the house always remember your: phone, wallet, souls of the
    damned, and keys.'
  - Everyone is afraid of death, but I've met him and he's actually a cool guy. Unfortunatly
    I can't go with him to the afterlife because I pinky-swore in middle school that
    I'd never die.
  - My favorite story is the Tortise, the Hare, and the Thermoneuclear Detonation
    that annihilated them all and half the world population.
  - Would you look at that, a completely impossible shape. Astounding. Feast your
    eyes upon it and you can see infinity. Is what I would be saying if you were
    in my living room looking at my paperweight.
  - The race will start at the sound of a whale being thrown into a swimming pool
    filled with pudding while spontaneously combusting.
  - Just in case you were wondering, all the digits of PI are 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510

    18577805321712268066130019278766111959092164201989. I'll be honest it was supposed
    to get cut off here.
  - Here in the future, we celebrate brick day! The day is dedicated to the day a
    brick fell on Dictator's head, knocking him unconscious thus costing him the
    war.
  - Hey you, yeah you, moron. Ha you just answered to "moron". What a moron.
  - In the future we have 13 months. This is because we didn't make our decisions
    based on our ancestors who had an irrational fear of the number 13. 96 is the
    number you need to be afraid of, that one's killed millions.
  - I'm holding your system 32 hostage, play the game of else!
  - To whoever invented beige; congratulaitons! You have made the most boring color
    in existence (I'm from the future and I can verify this).
  - Thank you thank you, I'll be here all week! Actually I'll be here until the universe
    implodes, then I'm going to Vegas.
  - The power of friendship has lead to the collapse of so many galactic governments
    that it friendship has been banned. If someone says you're their friend, execute
    them immediately.
  - When I was five I lost my lucky lunch box, so I went back in time and took it
    back to the present...wait a minute...
  - There's evil afoot, and evil at hand, all extremities are in danger! But danger
    is on of my five middle names! In case your wondering, my middle names are My,
    Middle, Name, Isn't, Danger.
  - Ok, I'm just saying, the emus have a 100% win rate when it comes to warfare.
  - This is just an opinion, but all the opinions that you have suck and i agree
    with the people who disagree with you.
  - Antidisestablishmentarianism.
  - There is no exit from the Rocket Jump Racing race track because nobody leaves
    Rocket Jump Racing. Ever.
  - The crucial turning point in the pineapplian-potatian war was the eradication
    of the ferret people armed with lugars.
  - Don't ever say "What's Up?" to me. Up is a construct of the current gravitational
    force, one I no longer abide by as I am an enlightend being who cares not about
    the will of a corrupted ball of dirt.
